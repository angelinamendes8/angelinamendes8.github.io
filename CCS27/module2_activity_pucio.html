        The Ozone layer protects the earth's stratosphere by absorbing most of the ultravolet radiaton from the sun.  
              <br><br>
        The Ozone layer is like the sunscreen protector of the Earth!&#127759;&#127774; 
             <br><br>
        Scientist have first observe the thinning of the ozone layer in the early 1980s (NASA,2019). Ozone depletion has been a long term problem here on Earth. With the innocvation of technology, goes along with the rise in green house gass production. This causes for more rupture in the Ozone layer.

        Scienties have been trying to warn us for years. Protesting to promote climate justice and serves as the warning for those who listens.
            <br><br>
        However, a recent report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the ozone hole in 2024 has shown a decrease, as noted in their Ozone Bulletin. The reduction in the stratospheric ozone depletion gave hope that the ozone layer is healing. This is only a small part of progress to solve the chronic environmental problem. But with this achievement if it remains constant, progress is possible, and this serves as the fruit of success with the efforts of scientists to warn us about the future.
